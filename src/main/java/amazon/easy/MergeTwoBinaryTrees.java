/**
 * Created by admin on 2018/2/3.
 * Given two binary trees and imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, some nodes of the two trees
 * are overlapped while the others are not.
 * <p/>
 * You need to merge them into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values
 * up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of new tree.
 * <p/>
 * Example 1:
 * Input:
 * Tree 1                     Tree 2
 * 1                         2
 * / \                       / \
 * 3   2                     1   3
 * /                           \   \
 * 5                             4   7
 * Output:
 * Merged tree:
 * 3
 * / \
 * 4   5
 * / \   \
 * 5   4   7
 * Note: The merging process must start from the root nodes of both trees.
